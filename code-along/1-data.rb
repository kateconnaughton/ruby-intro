# # Perform simple math with numbers

# puts 5+2
# puts 5-2
# puts 5*2
# puts 5/2
# puts 5.0 / 2
# puts 5*(2+1)

# # Strings

# # Combine strings together

# puts "tacos are" + " delish"
# puts "tacos " * 3
# puts "tacos: " + 3.to_s

# # Variables

# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3
# puts food * quantity

# # Combine strings and variables
